# Task “Migrations with Hibernate*” (task marked with an asterisk)

## Description

This task is optional; completing it does not affect your grade.

It's time to practice working with migration mechanisms in Hibernate.

**What you need to do**

1. Adapt the logic of the task [“DAO Layer with Hibernate”](https://github.com/mrkotyaka/hibernatePersons/blob/main/readme.md) so that your application works with both migrations and Hibernate. It doesn't matter whether you choose Flyway or Liquibase.
