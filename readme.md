# Task “@Query*” (task with an asterisk)

## Description

This task is optional and does not affect your grade.

Let's rewrite the application from [the first task](https://github.com/mrkotyaka/hibernatePersons/blob/jpa-repository/readme.md) to use queries with the `@Query` annotation.


**What you need to do**

1. You need to rewrite the code from [the first task](https://github.com/mrkotyaka/hibernatePersons/blob/jpa-repository/readme.md) so that it now works not through query methods, but through queries in the `@Query` annotation and the `JPQL` language.

2. Upload the written code to the same repository as for the task [“DAO layer with Hibernate”] (https://github.com/mrkotyaka/hibernatePersons/blob/main/readme.md) on GitHub, but create a separate branch for it called `jpa-repository-query` and attach a link to it in the comments to your homework assignment.
